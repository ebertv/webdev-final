Victoria: basic html/css, can also create handlebars when that is needed. I made a random button in the nav bar, that if you click it will take you to as if you had searched for a random song. Delete if this would be impossible/too much work. Most of what I did I borrowed from tweeter, so everything is changeable! It isn't pretty right now, but its something!

Rose: more advanced css/html, client side js

King: server side, api work
