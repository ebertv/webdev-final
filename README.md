The Spotify Wiki is a program meant to display information about any song found within Spotify's database. Searching on the home page will allow the user to see the top 10 results of relevant songs they have searched for, sorted by popularity. Features of a song can be accessed by clicking one of the song cards. The credits page details more information about Spotify's API and the creators of this website.
